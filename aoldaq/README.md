# AOLDAQ - Data Acqusition API for the Silver Lab AOL Microscope

This folder contains the C code for the data acquisition API. 

## Build Requirements

- A working C toolchain:
    - On Windows, Visual Studio is preferred
    - On Unix-like OSes, probably you already have everything installed
- CMake

## Building

- Create a subfolder named `build`.
- `cd build`
- `cmake ..`
- Build the project created in the `build` folder using your toolchain. If CMake
  used GNU GCC + Make, just type `make`. If it used Visual Studio, you need to
  open the created solution and build it.
